# Orion - Software Requirements Specification

## 1. Introduction

Orion is a productivity application that provides quick access to commands, search capabilities, and customizable profiles through a hotkey-activated interface.

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the requirements and functionality of the Orion application.

### 1.2 Scope
Orion provides a non-intrusive, keyboard-driven interface for quick access to commands and information, similar to spotlight or command palettes in other applications.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Core Functionality
- **FR-1**: The application shall be activated via a configurable hotkey combination.
- **FR-2**: The application shall provide a search interface for finding commands.
- **FR-3**: The application shall support command prefixes for direct access to specific command types.
- **FR-4**: The application shall support multiple user profiles.

### 2.2 Configuration
- **FR-5**: The application shall store configuration in a TOML format.
- **FR-6**: The application shall include a graphical settings interface.
- **FR-7**: Users shall be able to customize hotkeys, search behavior, and profiles.
- **FR-8**: The application shall validate configuration settings to ensure they are within acceptable ranges.

### 2.3 IPC Communication
- **FR-9**: The application shall support inter-process communication (IPC) between components.
- **FR-10**: IPC shall handle messages of configurable size with appropriate timeout handling.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Performance
- **NFR-1**: The application shall respond to the hotkey trigger within 100ms.
- **NFR-2**: Search results shall update within the configured search delay (default: 200ms).

### 3.2 Usability
- **NFR-3**: The user interface shall be minimal and non-intrusive.
- **NFR-4**: The settings interface shall provide clear feedback on configuration changes.

### 3.3 Reliability
- **NFR-5**: The application shall recover gracefully from configuration errors.
- **NFR-6**: The application shall log errors with configurable verbosity.

## 4. System Architecture

The application consists of the following main components:
- **Background Service**: Handles hotkey detection and core functionality
- **Settings Application**: Provides a GUI for configuration
- **Shared Library**: Contains common code used by both applications
